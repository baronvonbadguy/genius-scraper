      "I wrote this notebook to document my exploratory analysis on lyrical data scraped from the fine folks at [Genius]('http://www.genius.com') (previously RapGenius).  _ABOUT A WEEK AGOOOOO_, I started toying with ways to scrape an entire rapper's corpus, and it seemed pretty feasible even with no official Genius API available.\n",
      "\n",
      "After many design iterations, necessitated by a developing need to scrape many rappers' corpora with relative ease, I settled on a multithreaded pipeline design.  At each major segment in the process of data collection and parsing, exists a queue and a thread pool.  The queues for the steps are then chained together in a specific order. Each thread in each pool takes a job from it's respective (in)queue, processes it, and puts that result into the (out)queue for the next step's pool to intake.  This keeps the whole operation concurrent A.F. and allows the process to scale (presumably) pretty well.  I've used the Thread and Queue modules before, but this was the first case I was really impressed by the lack of boilerpate required in implimenting concurrency in Python.\n",

      "I used lxml for the html parsing, because BeautifulSoup, while elegantly designed, was going to be too slow for what I was going for.  For the lyric parsing and tagging I used regular expressions, because again, it's performant A.F."
